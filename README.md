# DIYstoX
This repository stores the code for my DIY paperless cave surveying tool based on the fantastic DistoX system. It is a work in progress, but the end goal is for this repo to contain the code, wiring diagrams, and photos required for you to make this yourself at home.

## Introduction
I'm reverse engineering a SNDWAY Laser Distance Meter so that I can add magnetometer, accelerometer, and Bluetooth modules in order to make a DIY [DistoX2 paperless cave surveying tool](https://paperless.bheeb.ch/). This will never compete with the accuracy, robustness, or usability of a DistoX2, but it's not supposed to compete, it's just a bit of fun for me. It's also a lot cheaper than me buying a proper one. This also isn't the first attempt at [reverse engineering a laser rangefinder](https://web.archive.org/web/20190819080621/https://hackaday.com/2018/05/22/hacking-a-cheap-laser-rangefinder/), but as these devices differ greatly I still think that it is worth documenting my progress with this one.
